I saw a cool solution to this problem which was presented to me by S.
Paavolainen. The idea is to override the standard malloc(), which you can do
just in the linker, by a custom allocator which

 1. reads the current execution stack of the thread calling malloc()
 2. checks if the stack exists in a database that is stored on hard disk
    1. if the stack does not exist, adds the stack to the database and returns NULL
    2. if the stack did exist already, allocates memory normally and returns

Then you just run your unit test many times---this system automatically
enumerates through different control paths to malloc() failure and is much more
efficient and reliable than e.g. random testing.
